                <p class="text-justify"> Pathiramanal, which means “Sands of the Night”, is a small lake island located on the backwaters of Alappuzha <span id="dots7">...</span><span id="more7"> in Lake Vembanad. It is a bird watcher’s paradise since it is supposed to hold approximately 91 local species of birds and 50 species of migratory birds. The location of the island is extremely scenic, making it a lovely space to observe birds and the water.
                It is also completely uninhabited so you don’t have to worry about the crowd and hawkers disrupting the beauty. However, because it is uninhabited and not a major tourist hotspot, you will find that it lacks the usual facilities that bring tourists to comfort like benches in order to sit, restrooms, and places to buy food from. Let this not be a distraction since the island is very small and can be toured within an hour, which means that you won’t necessarily be inconvenienced by the lack of facilities, especially if you go prepared.
                The ride across Lake Vembanad is lovely as is the experience of walking through the island. If you happen to visit in the right season, you will find yourself surrounded by the chirpy sounds of thousands of birds. This certainly makes for one of the places to visit in Alleppey.

                <p class="text-justify"> This is one of the most beautiful Alappuzha tourist places that you absolutely cannot miss. Vembanad Lake is Kerala’s <span id="dots8">...</span><span id="more8"> longest lake and is also among the largest in India. Several canals empty their water into the lake at several points along its wide expanse. Since it is a long lake, it covers many districts of Kerala and goes by different names in each district like Punnamada Lake in Kuttanad, Kochi Lake in Kochi. Many small islands dot its length. 
                Boating in this lake is a part of backwater trip in Kerala. The Kumarakom Tourist Village offers houseboat cruises and holiday packages which you can take advantage of and so have the best possible backwater boating experience on your trip. The lake is full of exciting possibilities- just imagine yourself floating on the lake early in the morning, sipping a hot cup of coffee and listening to the gentle lapping of the waves and chirping of birds. Now that is peace and happiness! 
                If you get a chance to go to this place during August, you will be in luck. The Annual Snake Boat Race or Vallam Kali takes place at this time and is a major attraction. The sight is amazing, to say the least. Do plan a houseboat trip on the lake while planning your Kerala itinerary.
